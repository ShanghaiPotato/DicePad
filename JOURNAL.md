Followed the website tutorial, made it to the PCB routing part of it. I plan on making the hackpad in the shape of a d4 dice so that each side of the dice has a button that allows you to roll it.

Finished checking errors on the PCB. I think I'll change the idea so instead of the PCB being in the shape of a d4, instead it will have all the different buttons for a full D&D dice set. That means a button for the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and the d20 (nobody ever uses the percentile die).

It is just the basic hackpad with more buttons for the 6 commonly used dice.
