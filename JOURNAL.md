Followed the website tutorial, made it to the PCB routing part of it. I plan on making the hackpad in the shape of a d4 dice so that each side of the dice has a button that allows you to roll it.

Finished checking errors on the PCB. I think I'll change the idea so instead of the PCB being in the shape of a d4, instead it will have all the different buttons for a full D&D dice set. That means a button for the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and the d20 (nobody ever uses the percentile die).

It is just the basic hackpad with more buttons for the 6 commonly used dice. 
It will probably have the LED's light up depending on the roll, if it is higher than half the maximum value, a green LED will light up, and if it is less than half the maximum value, then a red LED will light up. In the future I might add options for custum dice like a d3, d5, etc.

Today was mostly a organize everything and make sure I have everything. I did some more research into keymapping with QMK and KMK, and I'll probably do KMK. It just seems a lot simpler for what I am doing. I've uploaded everthing to the repository, so I should be good for the most part. I finished the CAD yesterday, I just forgot to mention it, and I got the gerbers for the PCB. I just need to finish the README before I can submit and ship this project.

Note: I do need to modify the CAD just a bit because I forgot to add holes for the LEDs.
