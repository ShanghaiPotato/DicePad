Description: A hackpad that has 6 buttons for the 6 commonly used dice in Dungeons and Dragons. There is the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 (nobody uses the percentile die). It will send the rolled number to the computer for whatever rollplaying game you want. Two LEDs will light up depending on the roll, green for a roll higher than half the maximum value of the die and red for a roll lower than half the maximum value of the die. 

Inspiration: Dungeons and Dragons is a game that I love, and being able to roll dice using a macropad sounds really fun and interesting.

CAD: 
I used OnShape to create the case, it is something that is reall basic, but I plan on upgrading the case later depending on how all the parts come together.

Firmware: 
I'm not that big of a programmer, so I chose KMK because I have some experience in python and it is much simpler to use.
