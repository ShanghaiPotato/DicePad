Description: A hackpad that has 6 buttons for the 6 commonly used dice in Dungeons and Dragons. There is the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 (nobody uses the percentile die). It is just a basic hackpad with more buttons and a little extra design. 

Inspiration: Dungeons and Dragons is a game that I love, and being able to roll dice using a macropad sounds really fun and interesting.
