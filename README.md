Description: A hackpad in the shape of a d4. Each side has a button that can be programmed to a specific task. The goal is to make it wireless so you can roll the hackpad and it will activate depending on which side you land on. \

Inspiration: Dungeons and Dragons is a game that I love, and the idea of rolling a dice and causing something to happen sounds incredibly fun.
